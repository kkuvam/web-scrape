#  Web Scraping Technology Evaluation using Python

## Overview
This repository is the outcome of an internship project by **Kunsh Kuvam**, focused on evaluating multiple web scraping technologies in Python and selecting the most scalable and efficient solution for real-world use cases. After extensive testing of various frameworks, **Scrapy** was chosen for its performance, modularity, and support for advanced features like asynchronous crawling and request queuing.
